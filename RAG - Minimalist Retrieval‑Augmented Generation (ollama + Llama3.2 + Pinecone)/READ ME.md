# RAG with LangChain: Query Analysis and Retrieval Augmented Generation

This contains an implementation of **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/). The project demonstrates how to perform query analysis and integrate document retrieval to enhance response generation. This implementation is based on the LangChain tutorial for [query analysis](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/#query-analysis).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase how to combine query analysis with a retrieval system in order to improve language model outputs. The implementation:
- Analyzes and rewrites queries for better document retrieval.
- Uses a vector store (e.g., FAISS) to fetch relevant context.
- Integrates the retrieved context with a language model for augmented generation.

This setup is ideal for applications such as question answering, document search, and conversational agents.

## Features

- **Query Analysis:** Processes and rewrites user queries for more effective document retrieval.
- **Retrieval:** Integrates with a vector store for fetching contextually relevant documents.
- **Augmented Generation:** Combines query analysis and retrieval to provide enhanced, context-aware responses.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable components to modify query processing, retrieval strategies, or language model interactions.
